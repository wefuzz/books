He convinced a crack  group of coders to join him in his quest to make a super-charged, global computer.</p><p>The Infinite Machine introduces Vitalik‚Äôs ingenious idea and unfolds Ethereum‚Äôs chaotic beginnings. It then explores the brilliant innovation and reckless greed the platform‚Äïan infinitely adaptable foundation for experimentation and new applications‚Äïhas unleashed and the consequences that resulted as the frenzy surrounding it grew: increased regulatory scrutiny, incipient Wall Street interest, and the founding team‚Äôs effort to get the Ethereum platform to scale so it can eventually be  accessible to the masses.</p><p>Financial journalist and cryptocurrency expert Camila Russo details the wild and often hapless adventures of a team of hippy-anarchists, reluctantly led by an ambivalent visionary, and lays out how this new foundation for the internet will spur both transformation and fraud‚Äïturning some into millionaires and others into felons‚Äïand revolutionize our ideas about money.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="blockchain-bubble-or-revolution-the-future-of-bitcoin-blockchains-and-cryptocurrencies"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0578528150/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blockchain Bubble or Revolution: The Future of Bitcoin, Blockchains, and Cryptocurrencies</a><a class="hash-link" href="#blockchain-bubble-or-revolution-the-future-of-bitcoin-blockchains-and-cryptocurrencies" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><img loading="lazy" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/P/0578528150.01._SCLZZZZZZZ_SX500_.jpg" width="120px" class="img_ev3q"><p>There are few technologies as divisive as blockchain.

Privacy exists only until the next hack. Credit card fraud is a fact of life. Many of the ‚Äúlegacy systems‚Äù once designed to make our lives easier and our economy more efficient are no longer up to the task. Yet there is a way past all this‚Äïa new kind of operating system with the potential to revolutionize vast swaths of our economy: the blockchain.</p><p>In The Truth Machine, Michael J. Casey and Paul Vigna demystify the blockchain and explain why it can restore personal control over our data, assets, and identities; grant billions of excluded people access to the global economy; and shift the balance of power to revive society‚Äôs faith in itself. They reveal the disruption it promises for industries including finance, tech, legal, and shipping.</p><p>Casey and Vigna expose the challenge of replacing trusted (and not-so-trusted) institutions on which we‚Äôve relied for centuries with a radical model that bypasses them. The Truth Machine reveals the empowerment possible when self-interested middlemen give way to the transparency of the blockchain, while highlighting the job losses, assertion of special interests, and threat to social cohesion that will accompany this shift. With the same balanced perspective they brought to The Age of Cryptocurrency, Casey and Vigna show why we all must care about the path that blockchain technology takes‚Äïmoving humanity forward, not backward.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="blockchain-revolution-how-the-technology-behind-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies-is-changing-the-world"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1101980141/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blockchain Revolution: How the Technology Behind Bitcoin and Other Cryptocurrencies Is Changing the World</a><a class="hash-link" href="#blockchain-revolution-how-the-technology-behind-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies-is-changing-the-world" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><img loading="lazy" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/P/1101980141.01._SCLZZZZZZZ_SX500_.jpg" width="120px" class="img_ev3q"><p>The first, foundational book on blockchain technology, from the bestselling author of Wikinomics Don Tapscott and blockchain expert Alex Tapscott, now in paperback with a new preface and chapter explaining recent developments in the world of blockchain, including cryptoassets, ICOs, smart contracts, and more.</p><p>&quot;This book has had an enormous impact on the evolution of blockchain in the world.&quot;

BLAN can greatly enhance the operation of the ‚ÄòVXLAN‚Äô technology by adding a control-plane component to it, and it can also extend VXLAN working domain beyond the boundary of a local domain.</p><p>BLAN operation across the Internet makes it more appealing as a viable WAN option for many customers (SME, large enterprises, service providers, Telcos‚Ä¶) in front of conventional WAN options (like: Dedicated links, MPLS or VPN across the Internet) or modern options (like: SD-WAN).</p><p>Our targeted audience is not limited to the Telecommunications or the Crypto folks, even if you are an investor looking for an interesting opportunity in the Crypto World; this one is also for you.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="iot-ai-and-blockchain-for-net-"><a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-3709-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IoT, AI, and Blockchain for .NET </a><a class="hash-link" href="#iot-ai-and-blockchain-for-net-" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><img loading="lazy" src="https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/cover-hires/book/978-1-4842-3709-0?as=webp" width="120px" class="img_ev3q"><p>Brings together cutting-edge technologies that developers need to master in order to compete in today&#x27;s marketplace</p><p>Demonstrates how complex capabilities can be provided and consumed as a service in the form of easy-to-use APIs, making them more accessible than ever before</p><p>Contains examples in C# that can easily be applied across a wide range of platforms, including web, desktop, and mobile</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="blockchain-basics-a-non-technical-introduction-in-25-steps-"><a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-2604-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blockchain Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction in 25 Steps </a><a class="hash-link" href="#blockchain-basics-a-non-technical-introduction-in-25-steps-" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><img loading="lazy" src="https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/cover-hires/book/978-1-4842-2604-9?as=webp" width="120px" class="img_ev3q"><p>In 25 concise steps, you will learn the basics of blockchain technology.

He sees in the past, both recent and ancient, evidence for several possible futures. Looking further back to a world before cash and central banks, there were multiple ‚Äòcurrencies‚Äô operating at the level of communities, and the use of barter for transactions. Perhaps technology will take us back to the future, a future that began back in 1971, when money became a claim backed by reputation rather than by physical commodities of any kind. Since then, money has been bits. The author shows that these phenomena are not only possible in the future, but already upon us. We may well want to make transactions in Tesco points, Air Miles, Manchester United pounds, Microsoft dollars, Islamic e-gold or Cornish e-tin. The use of cash is already in decline, and is certain to vanish from polite society. The newest technologies will take money back to its origins: a substitute for memory, a record of mutual debt obligations within multiple overlapping communities. This time though, money will be smart. It will be money that reflects the values of the communities that produced it. Future money will know where it has been, who has been using it and what they have been using it for.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-quick-guide-on-building-a-gpu-mining-rig-edition-32"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/quick-guide-building-GPU-Mining-ebook/dp/B073TF84RM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A quick guide on building a GPU Mining Rig, Edition 3.2</a><a class="hash-link" href="#a-quick-guide-on-building-a-gpu-mining-rig-edition-32" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><img loading="lazy" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/51GhdhXUYfL.jpg" width="120px" class="img_ev3q"><p>This book answers the questions about &quot;What does it mean to mine a cryptocurrency such as Ethereum?&quot;, &quot;How to mine with a graphics card (GPU)?&quot;, &quot;How to start your GPU mining business with only $100&quot;, &quot;How to deal with generated heat from a GPU mining rig and how to extend the life of the components?&quot;, and &quot;How much money does a GPU mining rig make?&quot;.
