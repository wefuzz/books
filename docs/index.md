### [Blockchain and the Law: The Rule of Code](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674241596)

<img src="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/images/jackets/9780674241596-lg.jpg" width="120px"/>

Since Bitcoin appeared in 2009, the digital currency has been hailed as an Internet marvel and decried as the preferred transaction vehicle for all manner of criminals. It has left nearly everyone without a computer science degree confused: Just how do you ‚Äúmine‚Äù money from ones and zeros?

The answer lies in a technology called blockchain, which can be used for much more than Bitcoin. A general-purpose tool for creating secure, decentralized, peer-to-peer applications, blockchain technology has been compared to the Internet itself in both form and impact. Some have said this tool may change society as we know it. Blockchains are being used to create autonomous computer programs known as ‚Äúsmart contracts,‚Äù to expedite payments, to create financial instruments, to organize the exchange of data and information, and to facilitate interactions between humans and machines. The technology could affect governance itself, by supporting new organizational structures that promote more democratic and participatory decision making.

**Primavera De Filippi** and **Aaron Wright** acknowledge this potential and urge the law to catch up. That is because disintermediation‚Äîa blockchain‚Äôs greatest asset‚Äîsubverts critical regulation. By cutting out middlemen, such as large online operators and multinational corporations, blockchains run the risk of undermining the capacity of governmental authorities to supervise activities in banking, commerce, law, and other vital areas. De Filippi and Wright welcome the new possibilities inherent in blockchains. But as Blockchain and the Law makes clear, the technology cannot be harnessed productively without new rules and new approaches to legal thinking.

### [The Infinite Machine: How an Army of Crypto-hackers Is Building the Next Internet with Ethereum](https://www.amazon.com/Infinite-Machine-Crypto-hackers-Building-Internet/dp/0062886142)

<img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/41I6E74NzNL._SX329_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" width="120px"/>

Written with the verve of such works as The Big Short, The History of the Future, and The Spider Network, here is the fascinating, true story of the rise of Ethereum, the second-biggest digital asset in the world, the growth of cryptocurrency, and the future of the internet as we know it.

Everyone has heard of Bitcoin, but few know about the second largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, which has been heralded as the "next internet."

The story of Ethereum begins with Vitalik Buterin, a supremely gifted nineteen-year-old autodidact who saw the promise of blockchain when the technology was in its earliest stages. He convinced a crack  group of coders to join him in his quest to make a super-charged, global computer.

The Infinite Machine introduces Vitalik‚Äôs ingenious idea and unfolds Ethereum‚Äôs chaotic beginnings. It then explores the brilliant innovation and reckless greed the platform‚Äïan infinitely adaptable foundation for experimentation and new applications‚Äïhas unleashed and the consequences that resulted as the frenzy surrounding it grew: increased regulatory scrutiny, incipient Wall Street interest, and the founding team‚Äôs effort to get the Ethereum platform to scale so it can eventually be  accessible to the masses.

Financial journalist and cryptocurrency expert Camila Russo details the wild and often hapless adventures of a team of hippy-anarchists, reluctantly led by an ambivalent visionary, and lays out how this new foundation for the internet will spur both transformation and fraud‚Äïturning some into millionaires and others into felons‚Äïand revolutionize our ideas about money.

### [Blockchain Bubble or Revolution: The Future of Bitcoin, Blockchains, and Cryptocurrencies](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0578528150/)

<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/P/0578528150.01._SCLZZZZZZZ_SX500_.jpg" width="120px"/>

There are few technologies as divisive as blockchain. Expert opinions range from it being "a scam" to "most important invention since the internet." It's hard to tell who's right. Authored by 3 Product Managers from Google, Microsoft, and Facebook, Bubble or Revolution cuts through the hype and offers a balanced, accurate assessment and analysis of blockchain technology. 

The book begins by demystifying the history of blockchain and how it works; dives into economic, political, and social challenges and opportunities around blockchain using an applied case study approach and featuring insights from exclusive interviews with nearly one hundred tech industry leaders. 

Bubble or Revolution will enable you to thoroughly understand the blockchain ecosystem and knowledgeably make a decision for yourself on whether it is a bubble or a revolution.

### [The Truth Machine: The Blockchain and the Future of Everything](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1250114578/)

<img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/51zLEWox+5L._SX326_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" width="120px"/>

Big banks have grown bigger and more entrenched. Privacy exists only until the next hack. Credit card fraud is a fact of life. Many of the ‚Äúlegacy systems‚Äù once designed to make our lives easier and our economy more efficient are no longer up to the task. Yet there is a way past all this‚Äïa new kind of operating system with the potential to revolutionize vast swaths of our economy: the blockchain.

In The Truth Machine, Michael J. Casey and Paul Vigna demystify the blockchain and explain why it can restore personal control over our data, assets, and identities; grant billions of excluded people access to the global economy; and shift the balance of power to revive society‚Äôs faith in itself. They reveal the disruption it promises for industries including finance, tech, legal, and shipping.

Casey and Vigna expose the challenge of replacing trusted (and not-so-trusted) institutions on which we‚Äôve relied for centuries with a radical model that bypasses them. The Truth Machine reveals the empowerment possible when self-interested middlemen give way to the transparency of the blockchain, while highlighting the job losses, assertion of special interests, and threat to social cohesion that will accompany this shift. With the same balanced perspective they brought to The Age of Cryptocurrency, Casey and Vigna show why we all must care about the path that blockchain technology takes‚Äïmoving humanity forward, not backward.

### [Blockchain Revolution: How the Technology Behind Bitcoin and Other Cryptocurrencies Is Changing the World](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1101980141/)

Bitcoin is starting to come into its own as a digital currency, but the blockchain technology behind it could prove to be much more significant. This book takes you beyond the currency ("Blockchain 1.0") and smart contracts ("Blockchain 2.0") to demonstrate how the blockchain is in position to become the fifth disruptive computing paradigm after mainframes, PCs, the Internet, and mobile/social networking.

Author Melanie Swan, Founder of the Institute for Blockchain Studies, explains that the blockchain is essentially a public ledger with potential as a worldwide, decentralized record for the registration, inventory, and transfer of all assets‚Äînot just finances, but property and intangible assets such as votes, software, health data, and ideas.

Topics include:

* Concepts, features, and functionality of Bitcoin and the blockchain
* Using the blockchain for automated tracking of all digital endeavors
* Enabling censorship?resistant organizational models
* Creating a decentralized digital repository to verify identity
* Possibility of cheaper, more efficient services traditionally provided by nations
* Blockchain for science: making better use of the data-mining network
* Personal health record storage, including access to one‚Äôs own genomic data
* Open access academic publishing on the blockchain

This book is part of an ongoing O‚ÄôReilly series. Mastering Bitcoin: Unlocking Digital Crypto-Currencies introduces Bitcoin and describes the technology behind Bitcoin and the blockchain. Blockchain: Blueprint for a New Economy considers theoretical, philosophical, and societal impact of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies.

### [Blockchain: The Hidden Gem of Data Networking ](https://www.amazon.com/Blockchain-Hidden-Data-Networking-BLAN-ebook/dp/B076X48V6Q)

<img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51dUqZ2LX4L.jpg" width="120px"/>

This is the first volume of the ‚ÄòBlockchain: The Hidden Gem of Data Networking‚Äô series of eBooks.
In this series, we will thoroughly define blockchain and see it in action, we‚Äôll see how ‚Äòblockchain‚Äô could be leveraged to enhance the technologies that exist in the Data Networking: i.e. LAN and WAN technologies.

In this first volume with subtitle ‚ÄòBLAN‚Äô (short for Blockchain-VXLAN); we‚Äôll see how blockchain can control an architecture that connects geographically dispersed layer-2 islands over any available infrastructure (even the global Internet).

Connecting layer-2 islands is not a new approach, we‚Äôve seen many successful solutions that fall under the ‚ÄòOverlay Networking Technologies‚Äô umbrella like: VXLAN, NVGRE‚Ä¶In this volume, we have: ‚ÄòBLAN‚Äô that is the result of the integration of blockchain with VXLAN.

VXLAN was originally drafted as an overlay networking technology that can work without a control-plane and its scope is usually within a single administrative domain (Data Center or Cloud). We'll discuss all VXLAN modes of operation along with the characteristics of each.
BLAN can greatly enhance the operation of the ‚ÄòVXLAN‚Äô technology by adding a control-plane component to it, and it can also extend VXLAN working domain beyond the boundary of a local domain.

BLAN operation across the Internet makes it more appealing as a viable WAN option for many customers (SME, large enterprises, service providers, Telcos‚Ä¶) in front of conventional WAN options (like: Dedicated links, MPLS or VPN across the Internet) or modern options (like: SD-WAN).

Our targeted audience is not limited to the Telecommunications or the Crypto folks, even if you are an investor looking for an interesting opportunity in the Crypto World; this one is also for you.

Hundreds of blogs, videos, and books claim to explain Bitcoin. Some of them work well, but only if you belong to the right audience. Many works throw non-experts into the deep end without a life vest. Others skip along the surface leaving non-beginners little of value for their time.

The result is unsatisfying at best and dangerous at worst. Without the knowledge and confidence to manage your own money, you may entrust it to others - the very situation Bitcoin was created to overturn. All the while, these services gobble up financial secrets for unknown ends. Even if you have no bitcoin, ignorance of Bitcoin's technical underpinnings makes it hard to follow new developments and spot opportunities.

The problem isn't you, it's the way Bitcoin has been presented so far. Owning Bitcoin takes a different approach that reveals Bitcoin's inner workings in an approachable yet technically sound way. Starting with everyday ideas, this book goes way beyond the basics - one step at a time. All technical terms are defined in plain English. Over 300 figures help to explain key concepts graphically. Chapters merging theory and practice lay out a practical system for securing your own money and financial privacy. Although familiarity with basic computer science concepts might be helpful, it's not necessary.

Owning Bitcoin will teach you ways to think about and use Bitcoin with confidence. Start today and begin owning Bitcoin.

Technology is changing money: it has been transformed from physical objects to intangible information. With the arrival of smart cards, mobile phones and Bitcoin it has become easier than ever to create new forms of money. Crucially, money is also inextricably connected with our identities. Your card or phone is a security device that can identify you ‚Äì and link information about you to your money. To see where these developments might be taking us, David Birch looks back over the history of money, spanning thousands of years. He sees in the past, both recent and ancient, evidence for several possible futures. Looking further back to a world before cash and central banks, there were multiple ‚Äòcurrencies‚Äô operating at the level of communities, and the use of barter for transactions. Perhaps technology will take us back to the future, a future that began back in 1971, when money became a claim backed by reputation rather than by physical commodities of any kind. Since then, money has been bits. The author shows that these phenomena are not only possible in the future, but already upon us. We may well want to make transactions in Tesco points, Air Miles, Manchester United pounds, Microsoft dollars, Islamic e-gold or Cornish e-tin. The use of cash is already in decline, and is certain to vanish from polite society. The newest technologies will take money back to its origins: a substitute for memory, a record of mutual debt obligations within multiple overlapping communities. This time though, money will be smart. It will be money that reflects the values of the communities that produced it. Future money will know where it has been, who has been using it and what they have been using it for.
